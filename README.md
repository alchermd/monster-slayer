# Monster Slayer

Turn based game I made to practice with VueJS. Nothing interesting, really. ~lels.

## Installation

I used absolute URL paths for the assets so using the app needs a web server. I recommend Python's `http.server` or PHP's built-in web server

```bash
$ python3 -m http.server
# or
$ php -S localhost:8000/
```

After that, visit `http://localhost:8000` to play!

_<small>(Or if you didn't care, just replace the absoulte URL's with relative paths and open the `index.html` directly on your browser.)</small>_
